# dom-binding

A tiny library that lets you make faux-models with properties that can be bound to the DOM. When you update the property, your bindings will update. Good for when you're too lazy to add a real templating system or something heavier like <del>Backbone</del> WebFUI.

## Usage

Soon.

## Testing

```sh
lein cljsbuild auto test
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

And navigate to `http://localhost:8000/tests`.
