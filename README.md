# dom-binding

A tiny library that lets you make models with properties that can be bound to the DOM. When you update the property, your bindings will update. Good for when you're too lazy to add a real templating system or something heavier like Backbone.

## Usage

Soon.

## Testing

```sh
lein cljsbuild auto test
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

And navigate to `http://localhost:8000/tests`.
